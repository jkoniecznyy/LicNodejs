## General info
The goal of this project is to create a web application for customer service of the housing cooperative.

The project is made as my bachelor's application. For now, it's all hosted on localhost, because I'm focused on 
learning how to code in Node and Vue. In the future the project will maybe be deployed on heroku.

## Technologies
The project is created with:
* Node 14.15
* Express 4.17
* Mongo 4.4
* Vue 3.0

## Setup
To run this project you should have Node and Mongo already installed on your computer. 
Then you can install it locally using npm:

```
$ cd ../LicNodejs
$ npm install
$ nodemon app
```
